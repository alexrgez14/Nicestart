## Login activity
This activity is the login screen for our app, with different text areas
and buttons to let the users log in to the application.

Although this is not the main activity, it´s the view that shows on
screen the first every time you open the app. This is achieved due to
this block of code in the Android Manifest file:

```xml
        <activity
             android:name=".Login"
             android:exported="true"
             android:theme="@style/Theme.Nicestart.NoActionBar">
             <intent-filter>
                 <action android:name="android.intent.action.MAIN" />

                <category android:name="android.intent.category.LAUNCHER" />
            </intent-filter>
        </activity>
```
